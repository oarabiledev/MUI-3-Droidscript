## Material-Design Plugin Using Native Framework

The native file directory contains all files that the native version of this plugin uses.
The native version can only run in android and the hybrid version can run anywhere.


It is recommended to use the Hybrid Version, although currently its development just began.

## What About The Future Of Native Version ?

I cannot answer that question, droidScript is pushing for Hybrid, and Hybrid is the better option
as of cross-compatability.

The native version of this plugin will stall till the Hybrid version catches up.
That means that the native version will not recieve any major or additional updtates.

That also means, users can contribute components for both and contributions to both will be accepted.
The native version will only get major updates via contributions and bug patches only.
