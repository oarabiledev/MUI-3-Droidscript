# MUI 3 Implementation In Droidscript:

Hey there, MUI 3 has been released some time ago.

I am tring to implement MUI 3 in droidscript, because MUI 2 is aging and is deprecated as of Droidscript version : 2.66.3

Which can be downloaded from the official Playstore, or directly:

[Index of /apk/DroidScript_266 (androidscript.org)](http://androidscript.org/apk/DroidScript_266/)
